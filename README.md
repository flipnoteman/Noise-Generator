# perlin_noise
My attempt at creating a perlin noise map using "apex" (that's what im calling them) points and relative distances.

"Perlin noise is a procedural texture primitive, a type of gradient noise used by visual effects artists to increase the appearance of realism in computer graphics. The function has a pseudo-random appearance, yet all of its visual details are the same size." 

## Features
- Can generate user defined map size
- Generate random noise between apexes

## In dev
- Generating different "terrain" types
- Multithread
